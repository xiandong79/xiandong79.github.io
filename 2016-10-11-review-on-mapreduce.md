# Review on MapReduce

## Advantages

MapReduce has a simple modeling API for de- scribing the computation by requiring all application algorithms to be translated into map and reduce functions.

## Weaknesses

As observed by oth- ers before in [24, 14, 15], this is too constraining, and a DAG- oriented model can more naturally capture a broader set of com- putations.
