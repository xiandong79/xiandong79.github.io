NNVM is not a deep learning library. It is a modular, decentralized and lightweight part to help build deep learning libraries.

NNVM offers one such part, it provides a generic way to do computation graph optimization such as memory reduction, device allocation and more while being agnostic to the operator interface definition and how operators are executed. NNVM is inspired by LLVM, aiming to be a high level intermediate representation library for neural nets and computation graphs generation and optimizations.
